<!--How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
I enjoyed wire-framing with a pair. I think the pair work in general was easier since this was my third pairing (including the GPS), so I'm getting more comfortable working with a pair over Google hangout. Also, even though it was a fairly simple design, I liked being able to have someone else to brainstorm with. I found pairing more useful in this regard because we could share ideas, rather than working through something that was more about us practicing skills that we are both pretty new to.


Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Definitely! It took very little time to sketch out some ideas, and think through where to put the various pieces. I can't imagine trying to just start coding and attempt to create a good design that way.


What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
Basically, simplicity, clarity, navigatability and good use of space are the most important aspects to creating a good design. I hate websites that are cluttered or have a bunch of obnoxious bells and whistles. And, a good wireframe should give a clear representation of the design you imagine.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
The four semantic elements that we used were: header, footer, section and nav. We also discussed article, and had some debate about whether to use article or section for the body of the blog. I think you could make the case for either one. These were all elements that we had both learned about in the reading, so they weren't 100% new, but using them in a real setting helped us both understand them better.
