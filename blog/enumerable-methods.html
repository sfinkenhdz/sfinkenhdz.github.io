      First, we learned about how to collect things together in Ruby with arrays and hashes. But what fun is just holding onto a bunch of stuff and staring at it? It's only fun if you can do stuff with your stuff. So, this week, we learned about the Enumerable, which is a module of methods that can be used to do stuff with your stuff in arrays and hashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the methods in Enumerable, you can search through an array or hash for a particular item that might be in there, sort, select or reject a certain item and do lots of other cool stuff. But what if you wanted to sort everything in the array or hash based on a certain criteria and then group the items based on that criteria? That's when group_by comes in handy.
  </p>
  <p>
      For example, if you had an array of words or names, and you wanted to group them by their length, you could do:
  </p>
  <p>
      words.group_by {|word| word.length}
  </p>
  <p>
      And, you would get a hash with keys that represent lengths and values in the form of an array containing all words of that length, like this:
      {5 => ["snake" "boots"] 4 => ["lake" "ball" "fish"] 2 => ["at", "be", "it"]}
  </p>
  <p>
      You could also use group_by to group these words by the letter they start with, like this:
  </p>
  <p>
      grouped_by_first_letter = words.group_by { |s| s[0] }
  </p>
  <p>
      Combining group_by with the random number generator, you could also mix your array contents up and assign them to random groups, like this:
  </p>
  <p>
      words.group_by{rand(3) + 1}
  </p>
  <p>
      Try these codes out, and think about what else you might want to group your collections by. I'm sure these examples are just the tip of the group_by iceberg, and just one more useful method brought to you by the amazing Enumerable.
