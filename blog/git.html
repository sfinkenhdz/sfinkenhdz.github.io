       You could think about GitHub as the place where all the gits hang out, but the real answer is a little more complicated. And, perhaps the better question is: what are they all doing there?
    </p>

         Have you ever wondered what it would be like to work on a project to develop a complex piece of software? Knowing only the small amount that I know about coding, When I think about some of the software that I use every day and some of my favorite online games, I imagine that creating these must have required thousands and thousands of lines of code with  many people working together. How could everyone possibly keep track of how their piece fits into the overall project? What if you accidentally changed someone else's code because you thought it was part of your section? How would you know that you are working on the most current model? What if one of your co-workers loses their flash drive and all of their work? What if you tried improving a piece of code, but then decided that the original code was better? How would you be able to go back to it?

        These are some of the challenges that create the need for version control. Version control means tracking progress and changes to a file, so that a user can easily compare different versions or return to an earlier one. It also makes collaboration easier because different people can work on different parts or different possible solutions to a problem, and then merge the final pieces back into the main file.
    </p>
    <p>
    	GitHub is a popular platform used for version control. GitHub lives on the web, so many people can have access to the same file. To keep things all neat and organized, there is only one main version of the file, called the master. If you want the best, most up to date version, you want the master. From the master, you can create one or more "branches," which are different versions. This is the safe way to play with different ideas or solutions, without changing the main version until you are ready. This also allows different people to take different branches to work on. When you're ready, the branch can be merged back to the master. As you're working, you can also save a bundle of changes. This is called a commit. With each commit, you'll write a message describing the changes, so you can keep track of what you did and why, and you can always return to a previous commit.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Now, of course, you're not going to do all of this right on the GitHub site.You want to be able to work on your own version on your own computer.That's where Git comes in. Git let's you take your very own copy of what's on GitHub, and save it on your computer to play with. If you are collaborating with others, they can use Git to make their very own copies so they can work on their piece at the same time. Then, you and your collaborators can merge your changes back to the master on GitHub for everyone to see.
     </p>
     <p>
     	Of course, there's a little more to the process than this, but hopefully this helped you begin to understand the benefits of version control, Git, and GitHub.
