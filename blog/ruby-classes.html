      Programming is all about efficiency and not having to repeat boring tasks over and over. Why not let a computer do it? They don't mind! Ruby classes help with this efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Classes are like a blueprint. They create a set of methods and variables to be used for a set of similar objects. By creating a class, you save yourself from the time and trouble of re-creating the methods and variables each time. By being a member of the class, each object will know what to do. An example will help make this clear.

      Let's say you are a huge animal lover who wants to have a ton of pets, like my daughter. Being an animal lover, you would of course want to take really good care of your pets and remember all sorts of information about them - their birthday, their favorite treats, their health, etc. So, you could create a class called "Pets." For each individiual pet, you would create an "instance" of the class.
    </p>
    <p>
      To create a new instance, all you have to do is type a name for the instance = Pets.new.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example: pet1 = Pets.new
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a class, any variables and methods you create will be accessible by all of the instances. Because of this, these variables and methods are called instance variables and instance methods. In our example, perhaps you create instance variables to store each pet's name, birthday and favorite treat. And, perhaps you want to create a couple of methods that will show whether your pet is sick or healthy and whether or not your pet is up to date on its shots. You would only have to create these once, and then each instance of pet will have its own copy of the instance variables and will have access to the methods. You can also create class methods that are accessible only by the class, not the individual instances. These are sort of meta-methods that do something with all of the instances. In our example, you could create a class variable to tell us the oldest pet, based on all of their birthdays.
