    Apparently, emotions run strong when it comes to determining whether to use classes or IDs, or whether IDs are even relevant anymore. In addition to reinforcing the nerdy stereotype associated with programmers, this points to coding as the rapidly evolving language that it is. Something that was useful yesterday might no longer be useful today. However, sweeping assumptions of irrelevance could also let us overlook a couple of good specific uses. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Whichever way your opinion falls, let's start at the beginning: what are classes and IDs and what's the difference? Both classes and IDs are CSS selectors give us the ability to apply a set of styles to one or more elements in HTML. You've probably guessed that a class can be used to style multiple elements, while an ID is unique. In the same way that each person has their own unique identity, and ID applies to only one element.
  </p>
  <p>
    This level of specificity is really what's got people talking. Ideally, code should be flexible and reusable, so it's hard to imagine styling one element and knowing with certainty that you'll never want to apply that style to anything else ever again. So, why not always use classes and keep your options open? Some programmers certainly think IDs should go the way of the dinosaur and the only reasons that we keep using them are sentimental - I've always used IDs, so why stop now?
  </p>
  <p>
    However, IDs can't be completely useless, can they? Someone did create them for some reason, and they do have some specific purposes. For example, when applying multiple selectors to an element. You can apply multiple selectors to an element. So, you could have several classes that all apply to the same element, or a couple of classes and an ID, etc. And ID will always be more specific than any number of classes, so if you have a complicated set of selectors vying to style a certain element that mostly matches the styling of one or more classes, but with its own unique style, an ID will help you do this. IDs can also be used to identify a parent element with other elements inside. For example if you want to style a list for a navigation bar, but not other lists, you could ID a <nav> element whose children will inherit the IDs style. Could you also just use a class and get the same results? Probably.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since much of the purpose of CSS is to give users the ability to change or add style to many elements at once, classes are going to be used much more frequently than IDs. However, I wouldn't eliminate write off IDs just yet. Especially sincd I just started learning programming three weeks ago and barely know anything yet.
