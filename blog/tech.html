      Why should you use test driven development (TDD)? For starters, test driven development is an expectation of most employers, so if you want to get and keep a job, it's a good habit to get into. However, companies wouldn't demand that employees use TDD if there weren't good reasons for it. Test driven development helps you compartmentalize code, think about precisely what you want your code to do, keeps your code cleaner by forcing you to focus on writing only the code that is necessary, and makes refactoring easier because you can tell if refactoring breaks the code.
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic steps of test driven development are: 1) Add a test, 2) Run all tests to see if the new test fails, 3) Write some code, 4) Run tests, 5), Refactor, and 6) Repeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adding a test happens before writing code, which is a key difference in test driven development. You must clearly understand the requirements of the feature about to be coded in order to create an appropriate test. Cases and user stories are used to understand specifically what you are trying to accomplish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your test should always fail the first time you run it. If it doesn't, that means the test passed without writing any new code. So, either the feature you are about to code already exists or the test will always pass and therefore the test is pointless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, you finally get to write your code. It doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to pass the test. You'll clean up the code when you refactor. Right now you're only goal is to pass the test.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, run the test and make sure your code passes. If it doesn't keep playing with you code until it does.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once your code passes the test, refactor. Be sure to run your test after refactoring to make sure your code still passes. Then, repeat the entire process for each feature you wish to add.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although test driven development may seem like a lot of extra work up front, it actually makes the process more efficient and results in better code. Try it, you'll like it!
