What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
Conceptually, I feel like I understand the difference amoung these, but it was good practice to figure out how to format CSS to make each of these work. I got some good practice using the various property/values to format borders. I learned how to use margins to get some distance between nearby elements and to move elements around on the page. I didn't use padding on this challenge.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?
I learned that I need to practice this more. Positioning was a challenge for me. Most of what I did was based on trial and error, researching what to do, and then trial and error some more. I definitely have a better understanding of how to position elements, but it is definitely not as clear as I would like it to be.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was the most difficult?
The easiest aspects were changing font size, color, etc. Linking a pic from the web wasn't too hard, although a week or two ago that would have been a challenge. Positioning was the most difficult.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge? 
Again, I will say that one thing I learned is that I need to practice more. Although the ideas make sense to me conceptually, I need to get better at using CSS and remembering what code does what and what the best way is to get the result I want. This challenge also made it really clear why it is useful to separate HTML and CSS and use stylesheets, classes, etc. to style your website. This made it way easier to try things and then undo them, or make changes to several elements.
